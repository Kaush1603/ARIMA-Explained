#p=1 - Model is considering one previous time series values from ACF
#q=0 - Model is considering no previous time series values from ACF of residuals

#Data shows white noice. Model works best.
Box.test(residuals(fit1), lag=20, type="Ljung")
#p>0.05. Model is a good model.
plot.ts(residuals(fit1))
#Residuals are random and mean is around zero.
hist(fit1$residuals)
#Normally distributed.
#Mean is around zero but the plot is left skewed.
tsdiag(fit1)
# 2 values have z=2 which can be neglected as the data has over 50 points.
# All Acf values are within confidence interval. The model is a good forecast.
# All p values are well above the confidence level.

# Overall, the ARIMA model is a good forecast
